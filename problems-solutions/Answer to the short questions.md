# C++ Programming
## Problems and Solutions

## Problem 1
### a) Answer: 1
Static typing in C++ means that the types of expressions are checked at compile-time. This means that the compiler checks the type compatibility of expressions during compilation, which helps catch type-related errors early.

### b) Answer: 3
The C++ preprocessor is a tool that performs text replacement in C++ source code before it is compiled. It is used to modify the source code, include header files, define constants, and perform other operations that are not part of the C++ language.

### c) Answer: 1
A build system like CMake simplifies the compilation of project sources and its dependencies by automating the build process. It generates platform-specific build scripts, which can be used to build the project. CMake can also be used to create reproducible, platform-independent builds.

### d) Answer: 2
A typical C++ compiler translates and optimizes valid C++ source code to platform-specific machine code. It also checks the syntax of the source code and performs static analysis to detect bugs and other issues.

### e) Answer: 3
The linker is responsible for combining the compiled object files into a single executable or shared library. As it does so, it resolves any references to external symbols, which are functions or variables that are defined in one translation unit and used in another. The linker ensures that the symbol addresses are properly linked so that the program can execute correctly.

### f) Answer: 1
Some ODR violations may not be caught by either the compiler or linker. However, both the compiler and linker can catch some ODR violations. Therefore, neither the compiler alone nor the linker alone can catch all ODR violations.
